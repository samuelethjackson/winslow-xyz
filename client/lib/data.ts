Those who are willing to face challenges, fight for their team and keep going until they reach their goal. I have faced the obstacles of building a successful startup myself. Helping other founders build thriving businesses is my ambition. I mainly invest in Angel, Pre-Seed and Seed rounds and sometimes Series A."
